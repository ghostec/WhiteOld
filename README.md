# White's Lab

This is an attempt to create a game engine.

Objectives:
- Renderer to be Graphics API agnostic.
- Rely on a small and complete set of core classes
- Be extensible (The current GUI classes on Renderer as an 'example' of extension).

Requirements:

Libraries: GLEW, GLFW3 and OpenGL.

On OSX you can install BREW and hit

brew install glew
brew install glfw (you will probably need to use brew tap)

OpenGL is provided by the OS.
