# White's Lab

This is an attempt to create a game engine.

Objectives:
- Renderer to be Graphics API agnostic.
- Rely on a small and complete set of core classes
- Be extensible (The current GUI classes on Renderer as an 'example' of extension).

Requirements:

Libraries: tinyxml2, SOIL, GLEW, GLFW3 and OpenGL.
tinyxml2 and SOIL files are already included.

Using cmake.
