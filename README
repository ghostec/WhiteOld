White's Lab

This is my attempt to create a working game engine.

At first I am going to develop the necessary tool set to make a (generic) platformer game.

Requirements:

Libraries: GLEW, GLFW3 and OpenGL.

On OSX you can install BREW and hit

brew install glew
brew install glfw (you will probably need to use brew tap)

OpenGL is provided by the OS.
